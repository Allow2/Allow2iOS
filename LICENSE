        or indirectly by:
    (a) Your and/or Your Users’ use of the Allow2 Service, the Allow2 API or any Allow2 SDK;
    (b) Your Products;
    (c) Your Users;
    (d) any Product Data; and/or
    (e) Your goods and/or services and/or your advertising and/or sales and/or marketing practices.

14. Liability
  14.1. Except in respect of any Non-Excludable Guarantees, We do not represent that the information on this Website
        or any information provided by the Allow2 Service or via the Allow2 API, or any Allow2 SDK, or that the Allow2
        Service or Allow2 API or Allow2 SDK are or will be accurate, correct, up-to-date, uninterrupted or error free.
  14.2. Except in respect of any Non-Excludable Guarantees, neither party is liable to the other party for any indirect,
        special or consequential loss or damage incurred by the other party, including liability for loss of profits,
        loss of business opportunity, loss of savings, or loss of data.
  14.3. Except in respect of any Non-Excludable Guarantees, to the maximum extent permitted by law (and if permitted by
        law), We will not have any liability to You (or Your Users) for any loss or damage howsoever incurred in relation
        to Your or their use of or inability to use the Allow2 Service, the Allow2 API, any Allow2 SDK, the Website, or
        any Product.
  14.4. If Our supply of the Allow2 Service or the Allow2 API or Allow2 SDK comes with implied non-excludable guarantees
        which are regulated by the Australian Consumer Law, the extent of the implied guarantees depends on whether You
        are a ‘consumer’ of goods or services within the meaning of that term pursuant to the Australian Consumer Law as
        amended. Where You are a ‘consumer’ for the purposes of the Australian Consumer Law, We are required to provide
        and shall be deemed to have hereby provided the following mandatory statement to You: “Our goods come with
        guarantees that cannot be excluded under the Australian Consumer Law. You are entitled to a replacement or refund
        for a major failure and for compensation for any other reasonably foreseeable loss or damage. You are also
        entitled to have the goods repaired or replaced if the goods fail to be of acceptable quality and the failure
        does not amount to a major failure.”
  14.5. If the Allow2 Service or the Allow2 API or any Allow2 SDK are supplied by Us to You in Your capacity as a
        'consumer' of goods or services within the meaning of that term in the Australian Consumer Law as amended You
        will have the benefit of certain non-excludable guarantees in respect of the goods or services and nothing in
        these Terms of Use excludes or restricts or modifies any guarantee which pursuant to the Competition and Consumer
        Act 2010 (Cth) is so conferred. However, if the goods or services are subject to a non-excludable guarantee,
        implied by the Australian Consumer Law and the goods or services are not ordinarily acquired for personal,
        domestic or household use or consumption, then pursuant to s 64A of the Australian Consumer Law, We limit Our
        liability for breach of any such non-excludable guarantee implied by the Australian Consumer Law (other than a
        guarantee implied by sections 51, 52 or 53 of the Australian Consumer Law) or expressly given by Us to You, in
        respect of each of the goods and services, where it is fair and reasonable to do so, at Our option, to one or
        more of the following:
    (a) if the breach relates to goods:
      (i) the replacement of the goods or the supply of equivalent goods;
      (ii) the repair of such goods;
      (iii) the payment of the cost of replacing the goods or of acquiring equivalent goods; or (iv) the payment of the
            cost of having the goods repaired; and
    (b) if the breach relates to services:
      (i) the supplying of the services again; or
      (ii) the payment of the cost of having the services supplied again.
  14.6. In order for You to claim against Us under a non-excludable guarantee implied by the Australian Consumer Law, or
        under an express warranty given in respect of the goods or services provided by Us, You must provide written
        notice to Us with documentary evidence substantiating the claim, for Our review, and, in respect of the Allow2
        API, the Allow2 SDK, the Allow2 Service and the Website, must continue to use them only in accordance with the
        provisions of these Terms of Use.
  14.7. Upon receipt of a valid claim from You under any non-excludable guarantee implied by the Australian Consumer Law,
        We will contact You to arrange a suitable remedy. Where We elect to repair goods the subject of a valid claim,
        You agree that the goods may be replaced by refurbished goods of the same type rather than being repaired and
        refurbished parts may be used to repair goods. You acknowledge that where the goods are repaired and are capable
        of retaining user-generated data, it is possible that the repair of the goods may result in loss of data.
  14.8. Any warranty against defects provided by Us to You in Your capacity as a ‘consumer’ under the Australian Consumer
        Law is in addition to Your other rights and remedies under a law in relation to the goods or services to which the
        warranty relates.
  14.9. Except in respect of any Non-Excludable Guarantees, all conditions, warranties and guarantees implied in these
        Terms of Use are excluded, to the extent possible by law.

15. Termination
  15.1. If You are a Registered Developer, the API and SDK Licence and Your Account will terminate automatically if:
    (a) You breach any material term of these Terms of Use;
    (b) You breach the API and SDK Licence; or
    (c) You and/or any person on Your behalf commences any proceedings against any person alleging that the Allow2 API
        and/or any Allow2 SDK and/or Allow2 Service directly or indirectly infringes any patent.
  15.2. We may also terminate these Terms of Use, Your Account, the API and SDK Licence and/or Your use of the Allow2
        Service by notice to the email address associated with Your Account, if We deem solely in our opinion that You
        are in breach of these Terms of Use.
  15.3. If you cease to be a Registered Developer, or if Your Account is terminated for any reason, the API and SDK
        Licence will immediately terminate.
  15.4. If the API and SDK Licence and/or Your Account is terminated for any reason You must immediately remove the
        Allow2 API and any Allow2 SDK from Your Products and cease using the Allow2 Service and We may cease providing
        the Allow2 Service to You.
  15.5. We may take down the Allow2 Service or this Website or take any part of them down or offline at any time without
        notice where reasonably necessary to protect Our legitimate interests or to carry out maintenance.
  15.6. Termination of these Terms of Use, Your Account and/or access to the Allow2 Service and/or the Website does not
        affect any accrued rights of either party.

16. General
  16.1. Amendment: These Terms of Use may be amended by Us at any time, provided that You shall have a right to cancel
        Your Account if You do not approve the amendments.
  16.2. Assignment: You may not assign, transfer, licence or novate Your rights or obligations under these Terms of Use
        without Our prior written consent. We may assign, transfer, license or novate Our rights or obligations under
        these Terms of Use at any time.
  16.3. Severability: If any part of these Terms of Use is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the
        remainder of these Terms of Use shall remain enforceable.
  16.4. Relationship: You and Us are independent contractors and these Terms of Use do not create any relationship of
        partnership, joint venture, or employer and employee or otherwise.
  16.5. Australian Consumer Law: The exclusions and limitations of liability set out in these Terms of Use shall apply
        to the fullest extent permissible at law, but We do not exclude or limit liability which may not be excluded or
        limited by law. Without limiting the foregoing provisions, We do not exclude liability under the Australian
        Consumer Law which is prohibited from being excluded.
  16.6. Entire Agreement: These Terms of Use constitute the entire agreement between You and Us and to the
        extent possible by law, supersede all prior understandings, representations, arrangements and agreements
        between You and Us regarding its subject matter.
  16.7. Jurisdiction: These Terms of Use will be interpreted in accordance with the laws in force in Queensland. You
        and Us irrevocably submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts situated in Queensland.
